## Idea

- Connect renter and owney by eliminating the middle and establishing a structured and trustworthy process of Renting Real Estate.
- Owner will be able to advertise their property details on <a>website-name</a>
- Renter can go through the listings and connect with the owner or can comment his queries
- When both parties are in agreement then our service kicks in to automate the further process of creating a <b><i>digtial rental contract</i></b>
- Owner goes to his property listing, selectes the chosen property and books it with renter's Id
- Remove the newly booked property from open listings
